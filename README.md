Introduction:
This project is a simple web-based tool that allows users to parse text files and search for specific keywords within them. It provides a user interface where users can upload a text file, input keywords to search (space-separated), and then view the occurrences of those keywords within the text file. Additionally, the tool generates a bar chart visualization representing the occurrences of each keyword.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on the "Choose File" button and select the text file you want to parse.
Enter the keywords you want to search for in the provided input field, separated by spaces.
Click on the "Parse" button to initiate the parsing process.
Once parsing is complete, the tool will display the occurrences of each keyword within the text file.
You can click on the "Copy" button to copy the results to the clipboard.
The tool also provides a bar chart visualization of the keyword occurrences.
Dependencies:

This project utilizes Chart.js library for generating charts. It is included via CDN, so an internet connection is required to load the library.
